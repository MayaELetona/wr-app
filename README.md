## The problem statement of this app:
Student athletes, club team athletes and professional athletes struggle to maintain periodization plans, practice plans, practice times and athlete specific schedules organized. Athletes may never get or look at practice plans or may not know which periodization cycle their team is on. Athletes in club or highschool teams will reach out directly to partners or to coaches to see who is going to practice and coaches can have a hard time gauging who is coming to practice. Coaches create practice plans or have periodization curriculum that is posted in group chats that get lost or are constantly being asked what practice will be that day. 
## User Population:
Wrestling student athletes and coaches within clubs or teams who struggle with a streamline form of curriculum communication and communication. 

## Design 
The current design has three screen tabs. 


Home: 

The first two items in the header of the screen are the attendance scores and the current periodization phase they are in and the title of the practice plan. 
 
The home screen is the athlete's daily launch point. Here their daily schedule is populated under the activities area. In these activities boxes there is a button to see the practice/activity plan and a RSVP button that allows them to indicate to their coach and to their team that they will be at practice. The activity details contain the time, date and location of the activity. 

Dashboard: 

In this screen you will find three launch points. The first being my plans which links to all the uploaded practice/activity plans by the coach to the user. The second is my schedule which allows the user to input their custom schedule which will be the format from which the home screen generates its activity components. 

Ex. The user selects schedule =>  [ Mon: morning practice, evening lift, Tue: morning practice, Wed: morning lift, evening practice, Thurs: rest, Fri: morning lift ]

Their monday home screen will only display morning practice activity and the evening lift despite the coach entering an open mat option in the afternoon. 

The Contact Coaches button will lead the user to a pop-up modal where they can select to send an inbox message to a group of their coaches. Inorder to safeguard the athletes and the coaches athletes can only reach out to two of the coaches at a time. 

Profile: 


The profile page has the users personal information. This page allows the users to set their competition weight class as well as their current weight. The user can opt to share their weight with their coaches using a toggle switch. They can also select the club they are affiliated with in a drop down menu at the bottom of the screen. 

Calendar: 

The calendar page will be populated with the periodization plan. The weeks of days that are designated for each cycle will be highlighted in a different color. Ex. [High Intensity: Green, Low Intensity: Yellow, Competition: Blue] For each day that the coach has uploaded a practice plan or a periodization plan there is an PDF icon on the calendar that will open up the uploaded plans. Additionally, the uploaded documents may change closer to competition dates, the documents could be travel itineraries or tournament details.
